# Hyperparameter-Tuning (World Bank Project)

World Bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of our Visa-sponsored credit card, credit cards are a good source of income for our credit union because of different kinds of fees charged by us like annual fees, balance transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, and others. Some fees are charged to every user irrespective of usage, while others are charged under specified circumstances.

Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same – so that bank could improve upon those areas

I came up with classification models that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards
